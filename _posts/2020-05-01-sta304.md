The sample survey is a widely used technique for obtaining information about a large population at relatively small cost. Only probability samples can provide both an estimator and a measure of sampling error from the data itself. In addition to sampling error, non-sampling errors (refusals, not-at-home, lies, inaccuracies, etc.) are always present, and can produce serious biases. The course covers:  design of surveys, sources of bias, randomized response surveys. Techniques of sampling; stratification, clustering, unequal probability selection. Sampling inference, estimates of population mean and variances, ratio estimation, observational data; correlation vs. causation, missing data, sources of bias.  **Priority is given to students enrolled in Statistics Specialist or Major programs.**
