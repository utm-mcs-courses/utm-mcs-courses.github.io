A conceptual approach for students with a serious interest in mathematics. Geometric and physical intuition are emphasized but some attention is also given to the theoretical foundations of calculus. Material covers first a review of trigonometric functions followed by discussion of trigonometric identities. The basic concepts of calculus: limits and continuity, the mean value and inverse function theorem, the integral, the fundamental theorem, elementary transcendental functions, Taylor's theorem, sequences and series, power series.
