This course is intended for students in the Bioinformatics Specialist degree program. Possible areas in which the research may take place include: functional genomics (e.g., microarray and proteomic data analysis); systems biology; and the development of novel analytical methods for large datasets. Students will be required to produce a written document of their project and present it orally. In order to enrol in this course, students must obtain, several months in advance, approval from a faculty member(s) who will serve as supervisor(s). **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
