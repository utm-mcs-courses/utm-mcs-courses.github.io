A rigorous introduction to the theory of cryptography from the perspective of computational complexity. The relationship of cryptography to the "P=NP" question. As time permits, topics will be chosen from: (i) definitions of different kinds of pseudorandom generators, relationships between them, and ways of constructing them; (ii) secure sessions using shared private key cryptography and public key cryptography; (iii) signature schemes. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
