This course gives students experience solving a substantial problem that may span several areas of Computer Science. Students will define the scope of the problem, develop a solution plan, produce a working implementation, and present their work using written, oral and (if suitable) video reports. Class time will focus on the project, but may include some lectures. The class will be small and highly interactive. Topics, themes and required preparation will vary by instructor. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
