A unified introduction to image synthesis and image analysis aimed at students with an interest in computer graphics, computer vision or the visual arts. Focus on three major topics: (1) visual computing principles - computational and mathematical methods for creating, capturing, analyzing and manipulating digital photographs (raster algorithms, image acquisition, basic image processing, image warping, anti-aliasing); (2) digital special effects - applying these principles to create special effects found in movies and commercials; (3) visual programming - using Java and Swing/Graphics2D or C/C++ and OpenGL to create graphical user interfaces for synthesizing and manipulating photographs. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
