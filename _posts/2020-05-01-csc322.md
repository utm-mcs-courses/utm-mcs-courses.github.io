(Cross list with <a href="javascript:OpenCourse('OpenCourse.pl?Course=MAT302H5')">MAT302H5</a> ) The course will take students on a journey through the methods of algebra and number theory in cryptography, from Euclid to Zero Knowledge Proofs. Topics include: block ciphers and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); algebraic and number-theoretic techniques and algorithms in cryptography, including methods for primality testing and factoring large numbers; encryption and digital signature systems based on RSA, factoring, elliptic curves and integer lattices; and zero-knowledge proofs. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
