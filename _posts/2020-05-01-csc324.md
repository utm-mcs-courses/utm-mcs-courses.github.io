Major topics in the development of modern programming languages. Syntax specification, type systems, type inference, exception handling, information hiding, structural recursion, run-time storage management, and programming paradigms.  Two non-procedural programming paradigms: functional programming (illustrated by languages such as Lisp, Scheme, ML or Haskell) and logic programming (illustrated by languages such as Prolog, XSB or Coral). **Priority is given to students enrolled in Computer Science Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Bioinformatics Specialist or Computer Science Major programs.**
