Algorithm analysis: worst-case, average-case, and amortized complexity. Standard abstract data types, such as graphs, dictionaries, priority queues and disjoint sets. A variety of data structures for implementing these abstract data types, such as balanced search trees, hashing, heaps and disjoint forests. Design, implementation and comparison of data structures. Introduction to lower bounds.
