An introduction to the principles and procedures of statistics for the forensic sciences. The course covers both classical and Bayesian methodologies. Topics from classical statistics include confidence intervals for means and proportions, hypothesis tests on means and proportions, introduction to ANOVA, introduction to regression, contingency tables, and logistic regression. Topics from Bayesian statistics include subjective probability, conditional probabilities, prior and posterior probabilities, empirical Bayes estimates.  The course will use real life case studies to develop statistical methodologies.  Statistical computing will be required. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Statistics and Forensic Science Specialist or Major programs.**
