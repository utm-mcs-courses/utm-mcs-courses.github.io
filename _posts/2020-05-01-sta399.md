This course provides a richly rewarding opportunity for students in their second year to work in the research project of a professor in return for 299Y course credit.  Students enrolled have an opportunity to become involved in original research, learn research methods and share in the excitement and discovery of acquiring new knowledge.   Participating faculty members post their project descriptions for the following summer and fall/winter sessions in early February and students are invited to apply in early March.  See <a href="calendar_detail2.pl?Topic=Experiential and International Opportunities">Experiential and International Opportunities</a> for more details. **Priority is given to students enrolled in Statistics Specialist or Major programs.**
