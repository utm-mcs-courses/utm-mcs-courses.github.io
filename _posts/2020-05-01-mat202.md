Mathematics derives its great power from its ability to formulate abstract concepts and techniques. In this course, students will be introduced to abstraction and its power through a study of topics from discrete mathematics.  The topics covered will include:  Sets, relations and functions; Basic counting techniques: subsets, permutations, finite sequences, inclusion-exclusion; Discrete probability: random variables paradoxes and surprises; Basic number theory: properties of the integers and the primes.  The course will emphasize active participation of the students in discussion and written assignments. **Priority is given to students enrolled in the Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics Specialist or Major programs.**
